# 21-Or-Bust
This is the card game that was the basis for our second semester computing assignment. Some further modifications have been made.
The initial project used interfaces which have not been included in this project, so it may not run without them.
This project is simply a copy of my assignment with a few modifications that I have made since.

The game is a simply card game where cards are dealt up to a maximum of 21. If the result is higher than 21 then the player busts and
the next player is dealt their hand. Once all the players have been dealt, the house is then dealt their hand.
The player with the highest score wins (assuming there is no draw).
